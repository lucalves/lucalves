Hello, my name is Lucas and I from Brazil (:brazil:). I have a degree in systems analysis and development and a graduate degree in Software Engineering. I am passionate about technology and the power it has to change the world. 

I work as a front-end developer currently working with VTEX Platform, HTML5, CSS3, JS, React, GraphQL and studying others like React Native. However, always open to new learning opportunities.

I also like Flutter a lot and I have some articles about technology published on Medium, click [here](https://medium.com/@lucalves) to see the posts.
